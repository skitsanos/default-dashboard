Dashboard Skeleton made with React, Umijs and Ant.Design

## Why Ant.Design?

Ant.Design is a comprehensive, enterprise-level UI design language and React component library. It provides a consistent
and polished UI experience, ensuring that our application looks and feels professional across all platforms. The
extensive set of pre-built components in Ant.Design allows us to quickly implement common UI patterns, saving time and
reducing the risk of design inconsistencies.

## Why Umi.js?

Umi.js is a highly customizable framework for building enterprise-level applications. It offers powerful routing, state
management, and plugin architecture, making it easier to manage complex applications. Umi.js's built-in support for
server-side rendering (SSR) and code splitting ensures that our application is fast and responsive, providing a better
user experience.
